# [KODEX](https://www.kodex.ml)

This project aims to provide an extensive catalogue of kotlin multiplatform projects across various
maven repositories
out there.

## Motivation

The project is heavily inspired by existing community catalogues such
as [Awesome Kotlin](https://github.com/KotlinBy/awesome-kotlin)
& [multiplatform-libraries](https://github.com/icerockdev/multiplatform-libraries). While they all
provide the same
feature as this project (a catalogue for kotlin libraries), they all require the library authors to
be aware of them and
register their creations. This project aims to automate that to ensure the community has an
extensive self-updating
catalogue of all the marvelous kotlin creations out there!

## Structure

The project consists of two modules - a background processor providing the data feed and a webapp
for exposing it as a
catalogue.

### Scanner

An internet crawler that's meant to scan and identify kotlin libraries across the web. It is only
able to find the
libraries published with gradle-metadata, so older Kotlin libraries might be missing. Currently,
supported maven
repositories are:

* [Maven Central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2)
* [Gradle Plugin Portal](https://plugins.gradle.org/m2)
* [Spring](https://repo.spring.io/release)
* [Atlassian](https://packages.atlassian.com/content/repositories/atlassian-public)
* [JBoss](https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/repositories/releases)
* [Horton Works](https://repo.hortonworks.com/content/repositories/releases)

## App

The driving server and client to expose the data collected by the cli as a nice web-based catalogue.
